Basically, the way that our shader reads all this is an by an index.
It's a picture it is almost like an array but the types in the array might be different so this is an index as to which attribute you're reffering to.
All of these things by the way are called attributes.
So when I mentioned that a vertex is made up of more than just position, might be position, texture coordinates, normals, colors whatever.
Each one of those like a position is an attribute. A color is an attribute. A texture coordinate is an attribute...
So this index is just telling us hey what index is this attribute at
