A vertex has nothing to do with the position.
A vertex is just a point that is on your geometry.
The way that most people think about them visually obviously is by its position.
But vertices are not positions. A vertex is not a position.
A vertex can contain way more than just a position.
If I actually say that one vertex, I mean the whole blob of data that makes up that vertex which could include the position, texture coordinates, normals, colors, binormals, tangents, all of this kind of stuff. That could all be in a single vertex
