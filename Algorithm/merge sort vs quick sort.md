Quick sort is an unstable sorting method where as merge sort is a stable sorting method.

An unstable sorting method means that if you have two elements that are the same before the list is sorted,
Once they're not necessarily going to stay in the same order.

Primitive types like strings and integers, it doesn't really matter because they are the exactly the same.
But dealing with something like objects that could have different properties, you might want to keep the integrity of the initial order of the list. That's something what the merge sort does do.
