By Wikipedia

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
